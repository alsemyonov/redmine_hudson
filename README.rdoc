If you use old version of Hudson, plugin may not get test results and changesets.
Plugin store build information, if plugin can't get test results or changesets.
But, If plugin fail, never get test results, changesets again.

=== Plugin get build information when you access plugin (Hudson tab)
Plugin has no exclusive control, so plugin doesn't work when redmine works on multi-process.
I'll try next version.

=== Plugin can get recent build infomation, more than a dozen.
If Hudson has many build infomations, Plugin can't get all. sorry.

=== Something is wrong with plugin, you should try to delete data from database.
Use 'delete history' button in setting page.
